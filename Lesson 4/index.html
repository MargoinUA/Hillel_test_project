            <h5>The Scottish Fold is a distinctive breed of domestic cat characterised by a natural dominant gene
                mutation associated with osteochondrodysplasia.<br>
                This genetic anomaly affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward
                and down towards the front of the head. While this trait contributes to the breed's unique appearance,
                often described as "owl-like", it has negative effects on the cats' welfare.

                <li>Big</li>

            </ol>
            <h5>
                All Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia, a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage
                and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed and studies
                point to all Fold cats being affected by it.
                <br>Fold cats therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe painful degenerative joint
                diseases at an early age. Due to these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several
                countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat breed.
